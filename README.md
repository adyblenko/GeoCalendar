Hey buddy,

I'm using PhoneGap, Cordoba, will send you more links/resources later.
All code is pretty much js and html and is located under 'assets' folder.
As far as I remember index.html and geoCalendar.js is all the code.
Backlog is located in the geoCalendar.js

Last thing I was trying to fix is localStorage was not working.
Many more to go, but I think we could release the very first version after that
is fixed. (or at least start testing on our phones)

Cheers!
